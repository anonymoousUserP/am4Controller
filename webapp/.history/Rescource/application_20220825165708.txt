Respected Sir,
I'm writing to request a change in my assign work. At this time, I work [current work hours] at [company] as a [position]. For the foreseeable future, I'd like to change my shift so that I'd work [desired shift] instead. This change would take place [dates in which you hope for the new shift to begin].

The reason for this request is [reasoning behind wanting to change shift]. I'm confident we can come to an agreement, and if I could work these days, I'd be willing to [incentive for the employer to make a change]. I'd be interested in further discussing the matter in person if possible.

Please feel free to call me at [your phone number] to arrange a meeting time that's most convenient for you. I appreciate your time and consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Reason : 
I like coding very much and I am good at it. I joined the company so that I will be able to learn and enjoy coding and my work but to
be honest I am not enjoying my work. The only condition that I put before the HR(Biswajeet Biswaj) during my heiring is that I should be getting a good coding work to which he agreed. I like the framework development and Its my kind and humble request is to assign me in that It would be very benificial for both of us (com)
