Respected Sir,
I'm writing to request for change of my assigned work. For the foreseeable future, I'd like to change my shift so that I'd work [desired shift] instead. I have given a bref thought before writing the letter.

The reason for this request is that I am not enjoying my work. I like coding very much and I am good at it. I joined the maventic so that I will be able to learn and enjoy coding and my work. The only condition from my side before joining is that I put before the HR(Biswajeet Biswaj) during my heiring is that I should be getting a good coding work to which he agreed. But currently I am assigned in UI designing using UI editor. 

I'd be interested in further discussing the matter in person if possible.I like the framework development and Its my kind and humble request is to assign me in that. I will give my hundred percent for that and try my best to not to let down your expectation. I appreciate your time and consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
