Respected Sir,
I'm writing to request a change in my assign work. At this time, I work [current work hours] at [company] as a [position]. For the foreseeable future, I'd like to change my shift so that I'd work [desired shift] instead. This change would take place [dates in which you hope for the new shift to begin].


The reason for this request is that I like coding very much and I am good at it. I joined the maventic so that I will be able to learn and enjoy coding and my work but to be honest I am not enjoying my work. The only condition from my side bef that I put before the HR(Biswajeet Biswaj) during my heiring is that I should be getting a good coding work to which he agreed. 

I'd be interested in further discussing the matter in person if possible.I like the framework development and Its my kind and humble request is to assign me in that. I will give my hundred percent for that and try my best to not to let down your expectation. I appreciate your time and consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
