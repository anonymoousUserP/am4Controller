Respected Sir,
I'm writing to request for change of my assigned work. 

The reason for this request is that I am not enjoying my work. I like conceptual coding very much and I enjoys doing it. I joined the maventic so that I will be able to learn and enjoy coding and my work. The only condition from my side before joining that I put before the HR(Biswajeet Biswaj) during my heiring is that I should be getting a good conceptual coding work to which he insisted me that . But currently I am assigned in UI designing using UI editor. 

For the foreseeable future, I'd like to work in the framework development and Its my kind and humble request is to assign me in that. I have given a bref thought before writing the letter. I will give my hundred percent for that and try my best to not to let down your expectation.I'd be interested in further discussing the matter in person. I appreciate your time and consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thanking You,
Yours Sincerely.
