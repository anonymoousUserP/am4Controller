Respected Sir,
I'm writing to request for change of my assigned work. 


For the foreseeable future, I'd like to work in the framework development and Its my kind and humble request is to assign me in that. I have given a bref thought before writing the letter. I will give my hundred percent for that and try my best to not to let down your expectation. I appreciate your time and consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
